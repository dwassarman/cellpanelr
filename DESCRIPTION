Description: A Shiny app and R package for analyzing data collected
  from cell line panels. It uses data sets and annotations available from
  [DepMap (Broad Institute)](<https://depmap.org/portal/>) to identify features
  that correlate with user-provided data. Its goal is to make "omics" level data
  analysis accessible and open-source for everyone.
